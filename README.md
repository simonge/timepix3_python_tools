Selection of tools for Timepix3 simulation

simulation - Timepix3 events, including capacity to generate the associated raw signal stream from the chip.

equalisation - Python implementation of the chip equalisation process, currently only simulated signals.

flask - Front end for the other code.

Initially developed by David Amorim during a summer internship 2022.
